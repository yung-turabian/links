# TODO

+ Confirm that ensure kinded works, and make sure all references to subkind classes requiring kinded information is gone.

## Future plans

+ SO YOU CAN USE MINUS, when parsing operators should be of Section.Name (or Section.Minus) instead read as strings.

+ Update repl.ml and types.ml so you can print subkind environment.

+ Better error handling.
    + Check that an instance completes the class' contracts

+ If not polymorphic functions can be resolved at compile time but if not then will be resolved at runtime in evalir.
