# TODO

+ Update CFun to take a list of type and implementation binder and it should be all set to go.

+ Constraint doesn't seem to halt unsupported type operations

+ If not polymorphic functions can be resolved at compile time but if not then will be resolved at runtime in evalir.

+ Better error handling.

+ Update repl.ml and types.ml so you can print subkind environment.
